### Hi there 👋

> My name is Franco Pallitto, I'm aspiring data scientist with a long experience in trading (7 years) based in Switzerland.

> I'm a Defi enthusiast trying to make an impact on the world. 

> Learning Data Science in SIT Academy (Zurich)

> My final project for the data science bootcamp was about anomaly detection in Wind turbines. I develop and algorithm that was able to spot different types of anomalies with very little information. From there I trained a suppervised machile learning model that was able to spot and classify the anomalies.
